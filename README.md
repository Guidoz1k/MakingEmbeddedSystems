# Making Embedded Systems

This is my repository for lessons and final assignment of the [Making Embedded Systems course](https://classpert.com/classpertx/cohorts/making-embedded-systems) which I had the great opportunity to participate in it's first cohort, named Red Jellies :octopus:
The course is hosted by Elecia White, embedded engineer, host of the [Embedded.fm Podcast](https://embedded.fm/) and writer of the Making Embedded Systems book, book which is the main source material of the MES course.
