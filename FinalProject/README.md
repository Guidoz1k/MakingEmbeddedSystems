# Final Project folder

This is the folder of the final project! It consists of a prototype of my bachelor's final work: An audio tester. It should have a display, buttons and an enconder for UI and a DAC for the output. The idea is simple: To test what waveforms and harmonics sounds nice.

TODO LIST:
- [x] blink a LED to test the HAL
- [x] Implement the LCD interface
- [x] Implement the buttons functionalies
- [ ] Implement the soft-potentiometer functionalies
- [ ] Implement the UI state machine and structures
- [ ] Implement the DAC functionalities with interruptions
- [ ] Implement the mini DDS engine
- [ ] test
